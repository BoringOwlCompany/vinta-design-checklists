## 1. Test setup
* [ ] Have your prototype ready. 
    * Perform a quick dry-run to see if every hotspot is working as intended, catch any technical glitches, and check if all the interactive elements that the UI needs are enabled.
* [ ] Enlist people from different projects to test your UI.
* [ ] Book a room, and set aside enough time to test the UI with five people, one at a time.
    * For small features, 10 minutes per participant is enough. 
* [ ] Set aside some time to consolidate your insights after the test, about 5 minutes for each participant.

## 2. Running the test
* [ ] Preferably let participants use their own devices (smartphones or computers). 
* [ ] Explain briefly what the feature is about, and ask them to perform one specific action.
* [ ] Ask them to "think aloud" as they interact with your prototype.
* [ ] If the participant struggles with interaction, don't explain why you designed it that way. Focus on collecting useful insights. 
* [ ] After participants are done, ask them for feedback related to the feature. Let them speak freely and be careful with biasing them for a specific answer.

## 3. Evaluating the results
* [ ] Analyze the results right after the test, for each participant. Do it while the memories are fresh in your mind. Use this template to help you track all your insights.
* [ ] Answer the following questions about the feature you just tested:
*    [ ] Do the users understand the task they're supposed to perform?
*    [ ] Are the visual signifiers (buttons, selectors, checkboxes, links) clear enough?
*    [ ] Are users going through the predicted path?
*    [ ] Are the components finger-friendly (in the case of mobile views)?
*    [ ] Are users performing the task successfully?
* [ ] After the round of tests, go back to your design tools and improve the solution based on participants' feedback.

## 4. Follow-up
* [ ] When you finish working on the feature, let your test participants know what has improved and how helpful they were on your process.
